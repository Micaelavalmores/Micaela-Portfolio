PUNCHUP idea:
Within my case study data, I will add an interactive element for a quick showcase of the project. 
- An element where users can test/use the app/website from a card.
This can enhance the interactivity of my portfolio so users/clients/hiring managers can see the fruits of my labour and showcase my work live by directly engaging with prototypes.

Resources I would need:
- Figma iframe
- embed kits, plugins
- Framer Motion
- react Modal
- Shadcn UI
